# exercism.io-rust
My attempts at learning #rust-lang via the exercism.io track

I've been following Rust's development since somewhere in the 0.9 cycle.
I am fascinated by its potential, and have read the forums, RFCs, and blogs with abadon.
Somehow I never found a good "learn-me-some-rust" project among my work or hobby things, which brought 
me in the strange position that I could explain the reasoning behind some deep compiler internals (such 
as llvm intrinsics mapping), but still hadn't programmed a single hello-world in Rust.

## Why exercism.io
When I stumbled over the [exercism.io rust track](http://exercism.io/languages/rust/about), I finally decided
to download a rust compiler (thank you [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for making that a breeze!).
I spent so long not-starting because I hadn't found a "worthy" use-case for Rust. Exercism helped my conquer
that hurdle by saying "screw it, at least I'll learn something"
The exercises may be toy-programs without any practical usefulness, but I think that actually helps: If
the problem is trivial, it allows you to really focus on the new language and its pros and cons.

## Why rust?
Learning Rust is not easy, but I'd say it is definitely easier than learning to _debug_ an equivalent c/c++ program.
the rust compiler and borrowck force you to handle problems at the start, instead of when the bug decides to surface
(such as that-one-race-condition-that-only-triggers-on-mondays-whose-day_of_month-is-divisible-by-zero, or
that-strange-exception-that-keeps-showing-up-in-the-log-but-that-you-never-could-pin-down)

## Failure _IS_ an option
In this repo, I try to not-hide my flailings and strugglings. I hope my openness about my difficulties on this path 
will help grant insight into the "mind of a rust-newbie", and maybe even help others conquer their own difficulties.
